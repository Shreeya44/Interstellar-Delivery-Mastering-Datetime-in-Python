# Interstellar Delivery: Mastering Datetime in Python

## Overview

"Interstellar Delivery" is a Python-based project designed to help developers understand and manipulate date and time in various formats. The project emphasizes the importance of datetime operations in real-world applications, such as scheduling, planning deliveries, and calculating time intervals. Through this project, we demonstrate how to work with the Python `datetime` module and its various functionalities.

## Problem Statement:
You recently quit your job to start a space logistics company that uses rockets to deliver critical cargo to colonies on demand. Since you're still in the startup phase, you're handling everything yourself, including writing the software to manage complex scheduling and timing across different space colonies.

Before developing a full rocket flight planning and logistics system, you want to create core functions using Python's datetime module to handle dates, times, and durations. These basic functions are essential for your rocket delivery service. In this project, you will make simple reusable functions for working with timestamps, calculating rocket landing times based on launch and travel duration, and figuring out days until a delivery deadline to keep those customers updated!

## Features

- **Datetime Parsing and Formatting**: Convert strings into datetime objects and vice versa.
- **Time Zones**: Work with time zones using `pytz` and `timezone` modules.
- **Timedelta Calculations**: Add or subtract time from datetime objects.
- **Leap Year Handling**: Check if a year is a leap year and calculate days accordingly.
- **Daylight Saving Time (DST)**: Handle DST transitions in scheduling and time calculations.
- **Interstellar Time Conversion**: Convert between different fictional space-time formats and Earth time.
